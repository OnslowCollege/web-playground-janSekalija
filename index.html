                <p class="text-p-right">Kiki is bread. Simple as that. They have a masculine voice, although is concidered "?" gender. By far, they are the most obscure synth on this list as they have a total of 8 songs, all by their creator, Kaomoji-P, as listed on their VocaDB page. Kiki L. Noboom is very robotic sounding, which a result of them being an UTAU.</p>

             <p class="text-p-left">a.ko (left) and i.ko (right) are two sisters. They sing together as a duet, with them never being apart (no literally, all of their songs are duets). They are both feminine voices, and they too are also both quite robotic sounding as they too are UTAUs.</p>

                <h2 class="text-right">prtv_1</h2 class="text-right">
                <p class="text-p-right">prtv_1 was released as a test voicebank for VOCALOID β-STUDIO, a research studio by YAMAHA to quote "pursue the future of vocal synthesis." Whatever that means. prtv_1 is a feminine voicebank with honestly a quite relaxing voice. Unfortunately, she was discontinued along with VOCALOIDβ. I reckon that if she had a more recognizable name (there are 3 other "prtv"s) and a more interesting design, she would have been continues along with Gekiyaku, Ci-chan, and others.</p>

             <h2 class="text-left">SAKURA</h2>
             <p class="text-p-left">As a "default" vocal for the VOCALOID6 engine, it's obvious that she hasn't seen much use, but most really obscure VOCALOIDs have at least one song that had blown up for some reason, so it's curious how SAKURA—or most other "default" V6 voicebanks—never had that. She along with AKITO are, in my opinion, the best VOCALOIDs in general (yes, even better than Miku, who I'm not even sure counts as a VOCALOID anymore, but whatever.)</p>

                <h2 class="text-right">AKITO</h2 class="text-right">
                <p class="text-p-right">Compared to SAKURA, AKITO is much more popular, despite also being a "default" VOCALOID6 voicebank, and I honestly like him more. The VOCALOID fanbase has a lot of crossover with the Project SEKAI fanbase (mainly because Project SEKAI is a VOCALOID game), which means that he often gets confused with Shinonome Akito, a character in Project SEKAI. It doesn't help that he sounds very similar as well.</p>

             <h3 class="text-trans-left">ナインゼロ, 9z</h3>
             <p class="text-p-left">FINALLY, the first SynthV. SynthVs are my personal favorite VSynths, just because they sound so ~smooth~. Anyways, Ninezero is cool as well. His voice is very deep for a vocal synth, and the only other one that I can think of that even sounds remotely like him is Frimomen, who isn't obscure enough to make this list. He's also one of the only Dreamtonics voicebanks to have a known voice provider, that being the Australian singer and songwriter, Ninezero.</p>

                <p class="text-p-right">And now we have our first (Mandarin) Chinese SynthV! Although, she also has a English, Cantonese, Spanish and Korean voicebank. I'm not really sure what to say about her; just a 10/10 voicebank overall. Her voice is quite high (but it's still nice; it's not that high where it gives you a headache listening to it), and it's very soft at the same time.</p>

             <h3 class="text-trans-left">Vocalo no Ci-chan, Ci-chanβ</h3>
             <p class="text-p-left">Ci-chan (which I'm still not sure how to pronounce; I think it's しちゃん?) was released alongside prtv_1 and other voicebanks with VOCALOID β-STUDIO (as Ciちゃんβ (the one in the picture)), but unlike prtv_1, she moved on to be released in the VOCALOID6 engine as ボカロのCiちゃん. And, although her VOCALOIDβ voicebank is unavailable now, the majority of her songs feature her VOCALOIDβ voicebank. If I'm being totally honest, I'm not sure if I like her "actual" voice as it's quite deep, but high pitched Ci-chan is THE BOMB. I have provided two songs for Ci-chan, the first one containing her normal voice, and the second one containing her high-pitched voice. Don't get me wrong though! Both are good!</p>

                <p class="text-p-right">I'll be honest, I hadn't even concidered An Xiao for this list when I was making it originally as I didn't really have any oppinions on him; I just thought of him as the avereage SynthV. However, Vane Lily just released a new song featuring him and I suddenly like him. (Sidenote: that song—called Love Me—overtook his previous most viewed song on youtube in less than a day). (Sidenote 2: I had to import TWO EXTRA FONTS because Zen Kurenaido (the font you're seeing right now) doesn't support <span class="hmmMMmMmMmMMM">晓</span> or <span>ǎ</span>. And the fact that the <span>ǎ</span> is part of the Pinyin for <span class="hmmMMmMmMmMMM">晓</span> just kinda makes it hilarious since it was really just <span class="hmmMMmMmMmMMM">晓</span> screwing me over twice lol).</p>

             <p class="text-p-left">Unlike all the other SynthVs on this list, I actually discovered Feng Yi by myself without using a "most popular songs for each vocal synth" video. Albeit, she is probably one of the most popular Dreamtonics SynthVs (still ver obscure though), but still! Let me have this! Anyways, I dicovered her because I REALLY like the circle FLAVOR FOLEY, and they had made a song with Feng Yi called <span class=hmmMMmMmMmMMM>炜</span>WARD ROMANCE. Absolute banger, 10/10, no critique.</p>

                <p class="text-p-right">Last but certainly not least, we end of with Yumemi Nemu, a VOCALOID. It could only be a VOCALOID; it would feel wrong not to be. While Nemu is the most popular of the bunch here, she still deserves to be here as her most viewed songonly has 47 thousand views. This still means she's the most popular of the bunch though. Nemu's voice is very unique—I can't say I can compare her to any other vocal synth—and it's extremely satisfying to listen to; just makes me go ヾ(＠⌒ー⌒＠)ノ.</p>
